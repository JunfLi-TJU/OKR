# OKR
Source codes of algorithms and datasets for our paper "Nearly Optimal Algorithms with Sublinear Computational Complexity for Online Kernel Regression", 
accepted in ICML 2023.

We implement all algorithms with R on a Windows machine with 2.8 GHz Core(TM) i7-1165G7 CPU, 
execute each experiment 10 times with random permutation of all datasets and average all of the results.

The default path of codes is "D:/experiment/Conference Paper/ICML/ICML2023/code/". 
The path of datasets is "D:/experiment/online learning dataset/regression/". 
The store path is "D:/experiment/Conference Paper/ICML/ICML2023/result/". 
You can also change all of the default paths.

The baseline algorithms include: FOGD, NOGD, PROS-N-KONS and CON-KONS. 
Our algorithms include: AOGD-ALD and NONS-ALD.
